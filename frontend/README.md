## Job.ly Frontend

The frontend of the Job.ly application is built using React and Redux for state management. The application allows users to sign in, apply for jobs, and view their dashboard. Admin users can view all users, jobs, and categories.

### Code Structure

The frontend code is divided into components, pages, and Redux actions and reducers.

- Components: These are reusable pieces of UI. For example, the Navbar component is defined in frontend/src/component/Navbar.js.

- Pages: These correspond to different routes in the application. For example, the Home page is defined in frontend/src/pages/Home.js.

- Redux actions and reducers: These handle state management. For example, the user actions are defined in frontend/src/redux/actions/userAction.js.

### Running the Project

To run the project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can then install the project dependencies using npm install and start the application using npm start.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
